# Sigbla App Sample Project

This repository contains an example project for setting up build.gradle.kts to include the required Sigbla repository
and dependency, together with a simple Main.kt to prove it works.

Please see the [Sigbla documentation](https://sigbla.app/docs) for further details, as well as the
[sigbla-app](https://github.com/sigbla/sigbla-app) repository.
